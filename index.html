<pre><font face=  "garmand shadow" size="5">Pakistan, officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a country in South Asia. 
It is the fifth-most populous country, with a population of over 241.5 million,
 having the second-largest Muslim population as of 2023.Islamabad is the 
nation's capital, while Karachi is its largest city and financial centre. Pakistan
 is the 33rd-largest country by area and the ninth-largest in Asia. Bounded by
the Arabian Sea on the south, the Gulf of Oman on the southwest, and the Sir
 Creek on the southeast, it shares land borders with India to the east; Afghanistan
 to the west; Iran to the southwest; and China to the northeast. It shares a maritime
 border with Oman in the Gulf of Oman, and is separated from Tajikistan in the
 northwest by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor.Pakistan is the site of 
several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh
 in Balochistan, the Indus Valley civilisation of the Bronze Age, and the ancient 
Gandhara civilisation. The regions that compose the modern state of Pakistan 
were the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid, the
 Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta;[14] the Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions,
 the Samma, the Hindu Shahis, the Shah Miris, the Ghaznavids, the Delhi Sultanate,
 the Mughals,[15] and most recently, the British Raj from 1858 to 1947.

Spurred by the Pakistan Movement, which sought a homeland for the Muslims
 of British India, and election victories in 1946 by the All-India Muslim League,
 Pakistan gained independence in 1947 after the Partition of the British Indian 
Empire, which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions and
 was accompanied by an unparalleled mass migration and loss of life.[16][17] 
Initially a Dominion of the British Commonwealth, Pakistan officially drafted
 its constitution in 1956, and emerged as a declared Islamic republic. In 1971,
 the exclave of East Pakistan seceded as the new country of Bangladesh after 
a nine-month-long civil war. In the following four decades, Pakistan has been
 ruled by governments whose descriptions, although complex, commonly
alternated between civilian and military, democratic and authoritarian, 
relatively secular and Islamist.<pre/>
<h2> <font face="anchen bold">Independence <h2/>
<pre><font face=  "garmand shadow" size="5">The 1946 elections saw the Muslim League secure 90 percent of the Muslim
 seats, supported by the landowners of Sindh and Punjab. This forced the Indian 
National Congress, initially skeptical of the League's representation of Indian 
Muslims, to acknowledge its significance.[99] Jinnah's emergence as the voice
 of the Indian Muslims,[60] compelled the British to consider their stance, 
despite their reluctance to partition India. In a final attempt to prevent partition
, they proposed the Cabinet Mission Plan.[100]

As the Cabinet Mission failed, the British announced their intention to end rule
by June 1948.[101][102] Following rigorous discussions involving Viceroy of 
India, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, Muhammad Ali Jinnah of the All-India 
Muslim League, and Jawaharlal Nehru of Congress, the formal declaration to
 partition British India into two independent dominions—namely Pakistan and
 India—was issued by Mountbatten on the evening of 3 June 1947. In 
Mountbatten's oval office, the prime ministers of around a dozen major princely
 states gathered to receive their copies of the plan before its worldwide 
broadcast. At 7:00 P.M., All India Radio transmitted the public announcement,
 starting with the viceroy's address, followed by individual speeches from Nehru,
 and Jinnah. The founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah concluded his 
address with the slogan Pakistan Zindabad (Long Live Pakistan).

As the United Kingdom agreed to the partitioning of India,[103]
 the modern state of Pakistan was established on 14 August 1947
 (27th of Ramadan in 1366 of the Islamic Calendar, considered to
 be the most blessed date from an Islamic perspective).[104][105] 
This new nation amalgamated the Muslim-majority eastern and 
northwestern regions of British India, comprising the provinces 
of Balochistan, East Bengal, the North-West Frontier Province, 
West Punjab, and Sindh.

In the riots that accompanied the partition in Punjab Province,
between 200,000 and 2,000,000 people were killed in what some
 have described as a retributive genocide between the religions.
[107] Around 50,000 Muslim women were abducted and raped 
by Hindu and Sikh men, while 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women 
experienced the same fate at the hands of Muslims.[108] 
Around 6.5 million Muslims moved from India to West 
Pakistan and 4.7 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from 
West Pakistan to India.[109] It was the largest mass migration
 in human history.[110] A subsequent dispute over the princely
 state of Jammu and Kashmir eventually sparked the 
Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948.[111]<pre/>
<h3><font face="anchen bold" size="8">Geography<h3/>
<pre><font face=  "garmand shadow" size="5">Pakistan's diverse geography and climate host a wide array of
 wildlife.[172] Covering 881,913 km2 (340,509 sq mi),[173] Pakistan's
 size is comparable to France and the UK combined.[174] It ranks as 
the 33rd-largest nation by total area,[175] but this varies based on 
Kashmir's disputed status. Pakistan boasts a 1,046 km (650 mi) 
coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman,[176][177]
 and shares land borders totaling 6,774 km (4,209 mi), including 
2,430 km (1,510 mi) with Afghanistan, 523 km (325 mi) with 
China, 2,912 km (1,809 mi) with India, and 909 km (565 mi) 
with Iran.[178] It has a maritime border with Oman,[179] and 
shares a border with Tajikistan via the Wakhan Corridor.[180] 
Situated at the crossroads of South Asia, the Middle East, and
 Central Asia,[181] Pakistan's location is geopolitically significant.
[182] Geologically, Pakistan straddles the Indus–Tsangpo Suture
 Zone and the Indian tectonic plate in Sindh and Punjab, while 
Balochistan and most of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa sit on the Eurasian
 plate, primarily on the Iranian plateau. Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad
 Kashmir, along the Indian plate's edge, are susceptible to powerful 
earthquakes.[183]

Pakistan's landscapes vary from coastal plains to glaciated mountains, 
offering deserts, forests, hills, and plateaus.[185] Pakistan is divided 
into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands, the Indus
 River plain, and the Balochistan Plateau.[186] The northern highlands
 feature the Karakoram, Hindu Kush, and Pamir mountain ranges, 
hosting some of the world's highest peaks, including five of the fourteen
 eight-thousanders (mountain peaks over 8,000 metres or 26,250 feet),
 notably K2 (8,611 m or 28,251 ft) and Nanga Parbat 
(8,126 m or 26,660 ft).[187][188] The Balochistan Plateau lies in the 
west and the Thar Desert in the east.[2] The 1,609 km (1,000 mi) Indus 
River and its tributaries traverse the nation from Kashmir to the Arabian 
Sea, sustaining alluvial plains along the Punjab and Sindh regions.[189]

The climate varies from tropical to temperate, with arid conditions in the 
coastal south. There is a monsoon season with frequent flooding due to 
heavy rainfall, and a dry season with significantly less rainfall or none at
 all.[190] Pakistan experiences four distinct seasons: a cool, dry winter 
from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through
 May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June
 through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and 
November.[191] Rainfall varies greatly from year to year, with patterns 
of alternate flooding and drought common.[192]<pre/>

MovementMuhammad Ali Jinnah (1876–1948) served as Pakistan's first 
Governor-General and the leader of the Pakistan Movement.[76]None of 
modern Pakistan was under British rule until 1839 when Karachi, a small 
fishing village governed by Talpurs of Sindh with a mud fort guarding the 
harbour, was taken,[77][78] and used as an enclave with a port and military
 base for the First Afghan War that ensued.[79] The remainder of Sindh was
 acquired in 1843,[80] and subsequently, through a series of wars and treaties,
 the East India Company, and later, after the post-Sepoy Mutiny (1857–1858),
 direct rule by Queen Victoria of the British Empire, acquired most of the region.
[81] Key conflicts included those against the Baloch Talpur dynasty, resolved
 by the Battle of Miani (1843) in Sindh,[82] the Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845–1849),
[83] and the Anglo-Afghan Wars (1839–1919).[84] By 1893, all modern Pakistan
 was part of the British Indian Empire, and remained so until independence in 1947.[85]

Sir Syed Ahmad Khan (1817–1898), whose vision formed the basis of Pakistan.

Under British rule, modern Pakistan was primarily divided into the Sind Division,
 Punjab Province, and the Baluchistan Agency. The region also included various 
princely states, with the largest being Bahawalpur.[86][87]

The major armed struggle against the British in the region was the rebellion known
 as the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857.[88] Divergence in the relationship between Hinduism
 and Islam resulted in significant tension in British India, leading to religious violence.
 The language controversy further exacerbated tensions between Hindus and Muslims.
[75][89] A Muslim intellectual movement, led by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan to counter the Hindu renaissance, 
advocated for the two-nation theory and led to the establishment of the All-India Muslim League in 1906.[73][74][75]

In March 1929, in response to the Nehru Report, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan,
 issued his fourteen points, which included proposals to safeguard the interests of the Muslim 
minority in a united India. These proposals were rejected.[90][91][92] In his December 29, 1930
 address, Allama Iqbal advocated the amalgamation of Muslim-majority states in North-West India,
 including Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sind, and Baluchistan.[92][93] The perception that
 Congress-led British provincial governments neglected the Muslim League from 1937 to 1939 
motivated Jinnah and other Muslim League leaders to embrace the two-nation theory.[94][95] 
This led to the adoption of the Lahore Resolution of 1940, presented by Sher-e-Bangla 
A.K. Fazlul Haque, also known as the Pakistan Resolution.[96]


By 1942, Britain faced considerable strain during World War II, with India directly threatened by
 Japanese forces. Britain had pledged voluntary independence for India in exchange for support 
during the war. However, this pledge included a clause stating that no part of British India would 
be compelled to join the resulting dominion, which could be interpreted as support for an 
independent Muslim nation. Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi launched the 
Quit India Movement, demanding an immediate end to British rule. In contrast, the Muslim League
 chose to support the UK's war efforts, thereby nurturing the possibility of establishing a Muslim nation.<pre>

Picture of Pakistan flag

 The national flag of Pakistan, also known as the Flag of the Star and Crescent (Urdu: پرچمِ ستارہ و ہلال),
 is made up of a green field with a stylized tilted white crescent moon and five-pointed star at its centre,
 and a vertical white stripe at its hoist-end. Though the specific shade of green on the flag is mandated 
only as 'dark green',[1] its official and most consistent representation is in Pakistan green, which is shaded
 distinctively darker. It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on 11 August 1947, and it
 became the official flag of the Dominion of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, following independence from
 the British Empire.[2][3][4] The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan in 1956 and remains in use as the national flag to this day.

Most notably, the flag is referred to in the third verse of Pakistan's national anthem, and is widely flown
 on several important days of the year, including Republic Day, Independence Day and Defence Day. It 
is also hoisted every morning at schools, offices and government buildings to the playing of the national 
anthem and lowered again before sunset. A very elaborate flag-raising and lowering ceremony is carried 
out every evening by the Pakistan Rangers and their Indian Border Security Force counterparts at the 
Wagah–Attari border crossing between India and Pakistan, which is regularly attended by hundreds of 
spectators. The Government of Pakistan has formalized rules and regulations related to the flying of the 
national flag; it is to be displayed all day at full-mast on 23 March annually to commemorate the adoption 
of the Lahore Resolution in 1940 and the declaration of Pakistan as an independent Islamic republic with 
a constitution in 1956, both of which occurred on the same day. The same regulations also apply on 14 August
 annually, in celebration of Pakistan's day of independence; when the country was carved out from erstwhile 
British India as the homeland and nation-state for the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent.<pre/>

Picture of Pakistan climate

Pakistan's climate varies from a continental type of climate in the north (Gilgit-Baltistan,Kashmir,KPK), a 
mountainous dry climate in the west (Baluchistan), a wet climate in the East (Punjab) an arid climate in the 
Thar Desert, to a tropical climate in the southeast (Sindh), characterized by extreme variations in temperature,
 both seasonally and daily, because it is located on a great landmass barely north of the Tropic of Cancer
 (between latitudes 25° and 37° N).

Very high altitudes modify the climate in the cold, snow-covered northern mountains; temperatures on the 
Balochistan plateau are somewhat higher. Along the coastal strip, the climate is modified by sea breeze. 
In the rest of the country, temperatures reach great heights in the summer; the mean temperature during 
June is 38 °C (100 °F) in the plains, the highest temperatures can exceed 53 °C (127 °F). During summer,
 hot winds called Loo blow across the plains during the day. Trees shed their leaves to avoid loss of moisture.
 Pakistan recorded one of the highest temperatures in the world, 53.7 °C (128.66 °F) on 28 May 2017, the 
hottest temperature ever recorded in Pakistan and also the second hottest measured temperature ever recorded
 in Asia.[1]

The dry, hot weather is broken occasionally by dust storms and thunderstorms that temporarily lower the 
temperature. Evenings are cool; the daily variation in temperature may be as much as 11 °C to 17 °C. 
Winters are cold, with minimum mean temperatures in Punjab of about 4 °C (39 °F) in January, and sub-zero
 temperatures in the far north and Balochistan.


Winters are extremely cold in the north and the milder they get the more you go to the south.Spring causes 
heavy rainfall in the northern parts while it is mild in most parts of Pakistan.Summers are sweltering,boiling
 and extremely hot in central balochistan,southern Punjab and upper sindh while it gets milder the more you
 go to the north and the coast. The Monsoon season(late June-late September) also occurs in the summer season.
 Autumn is pleasant but gets cooler day by day with almost no rainfall. Winter in some parts even starts in late 
October-early November. <pre/>
